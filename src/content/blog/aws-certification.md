For the past two months, I have been studying for my AWS certified solutions
architect associate exam. This was the first AWS certification that I'd done,
and so I didn't have any prior experience in terms of what to study or what
the exam format would be like. I thought it would be useful to summarize the
resources that I used to prepeare, and what kind of things to expect when it
comes to the certification exam.

The number one thing that I recommend is to take the acloudguru.com solutions
architect associate course online. The course goes over most of the common
topics on the exam, has hands-on labs where they show you how to use AWS
technologies, and has practice quizzes. The course has over 20 hours of content
and you can enroll for only $15 on udemy.com. I would say 90% of the exam
material was covered directly in this course. The smaller quizzes at the end of
each chapter were not as similar to the format of the actual exam, but the mega
quizzes at the end of the course were VERY similar to the type of questions that
you can expect to see.

After taking the course I read the AWS FAQs for the following services:

* EC2
* Lambda
* S3
* Route 53
* DynamoDB
* RDS
* Aurora
* EBS

Also good to read are the AWS well architected framework whitepapers to
understand what types of AWS services you should be using in particular situations.

In the week up to the exam, I studied the "exam tips" sections from the
acloudguru course, and did a lot of practice exams online. If you just do a
google search for free AWS solutions architect associate practice quizzes, there
are many sites that have some, although not all of them are the best quality.
The best one that I found, that has a format that's also very similar to the
actual exam is #TODO this course on udemy (free).

The last tip that I have is to flag any questions that you're unscertain about
during the exam. It allows you to visually see approximately how well you are
doing during the exam, and you can return to those questions if you have time
at any point during the exam. Remember that it is probably good to aim for at
least a 75% on the exam to pass, so if you see that less than 1/4 of your
answers are flagged, then you are probably doing well!
