For the past two months, I have been studying for my AWS certified solutions
architect associate exam. This was the first AWS certification that I had done,
and so I didn't have any prior experience in terms of what to study, or what
the exam format would be like. I thought it would be useful to summarize the
resources that I used to prepeare, and what kind of things to expect when it
comes to the certification exam.

The number one thing that I recommend is to take the [acloud.guru solutions
architect associate course](https://www.udemy.com/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/).
The course goes over most of the common
topics on the exam, has hands-on labs where they show you how to use AWS
technologies, and has practice quizzes to test yourself on. The course has over 20 hours of content
and you can enroll for only $15 on udemy.com. I would say 90% of the exam
material was covered directly in this course. The smaller quizzes at the end of
each chapter were not as similar to the format of the actual exam, but the mega
quizzes at the end of the course were VERY similar to the type of questions that
you can expect to see.

After taking the acloud.guru course I read the AWS FAQs for the following services:

* EC2
* Lambda
* API gateway
* S3
* Route 53
* DynamoDB
* RDS
* Aurora
* EBS

I also found that the [AWS well architected framework whitepapers](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/)
were good to read in order to understand what types of AWS services you should be using in particular
situations. Many of the exam questions will test you on situational scenarios, so
having a deep understanding of how to create well designed architectures is a must.

In the week up to the exam, I studied the "exam tips" sections from the
acloud.guru course, and did a lot of practice exams online. If you just do a
google search for free AWS solutions architect associate practice quizzes, there
are many sites that have some, although not all of them are the best quality.
The best one that I found, that has a format that's very similar to the
actual exam is [this](https://www.udemy.com/aws-solutions-architect-associate-practice-exams-sampler/)
course on udemy (free coupon codes can be found online for two of the tests).
Doing these tests, as well as the acloud.guru mega quizzes the day before the exam
helped get me to get in the right mindset before taking the exam.

The last tip that I have is to flag any questions that you're uncertain about
during the exam. It allows you to visually see approximately how well you are
doing during the exam, and you can return to those questions if you have time
at any point during the exam. Remember that it's probably good to aim for at
least a 75% on the exam to pass, so if you see that less than 1/4 of your
answers are flagged, then you are probably doing well!
